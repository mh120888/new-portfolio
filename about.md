I am a web developer currently located in Southern California. Since 2014 I have worked primarily as a front end developer, but I also have experience with full stack Rails development.

I didn't start out as a developer though. I originally went to college as a music major, and when I realized I didn't want to (try to) make a living as a musician I turned to French literature.  Because obviously that has better career prospects.

After finishing up my undergrad, I went to grad school to study more about French literature.  I spent some time at CSU Long Beach and Cornell University, where I eventually decided to call the academic life quits and return to the real world of working people.

I had the good fortune to fall into a job working with people who built software thanks to my French-speaking skills (apparently there are quite a few French-Canadian software development firms who specialize in building on Microsoft platforms - who knew?), which is where I began to develop an interest in software. I learned quite a bit on my own, but realized I wanted to be able to dedicate more time to learning to be a developer.  That's what precipitated my attending Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco at the beginning of 2014.

If anyone's curious about DBC for whatever reason, feel free to contact me and we can talk.

After my DBC experience, I returned to LA and managed to find a job as a full-stack Rails dev with a legal startup in West LA. I spent about six months there before moving to Scorpion in October 2014, where I'm currently a senior front-end developer.

There's certainly more to know about me than a high-level overview of my work/life history for the past five years, but if I gave everything away why would anyone want to talk to me?  Speaking of, you can find my contact info down below :).
